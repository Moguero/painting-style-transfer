# Painting style transfer

### Project goal

This project aims at extracting the style from a painting and apply it to pictures. The extracted style will act as a filter, like the one you can commonly use on social media.


### Reference study

The project is based on a study called _A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style_, led by Leon Gatys, Alexandre Ecker and Matthias Bethge, researchers from the University of TÃ¼bingen in Germany.

### Methods

The first idea is to implement a CNN model to extract the style of a painting. 
The second part will consist of applying this style to a picture of a day-to-day moment.
